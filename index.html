                            In the pursuit of my thesis, I recognized a crucial need for an effective system to acknowledge outstanding students at SMK PGRI 20 Jakarta. Faced with the increasing demand for scholarships and the inherent challenges in equitable distribution, I sought a more objective and data-driven approach. Similar to the digital solutions addressing the demand for domestic workers, I endeavored to tackle the complexities of student recognition independently. Implementing the TOPSIS method in Java, my innovative Prestigious Student System aims to revolutionize the identification process. 
                            Much like the digitization of domestic worker search services, my system strives to provide a comprehensive evaluation, reducing subjectivity and ensuring a fair allocation of scholarships based on individual achievements. This project, therefore, represents my sole effort in contributing not only to academic excellence but also aligns with the broader trend of leveraging technology to address pertinent issues in various sectors.
